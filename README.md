## Artificial Intelligence Projects

## Project Description
This repository contains projects completed as part of the course "Intro to Artificial Intelligence (CS440)". The main project involves the implementation of the A* algorithm and its various versions (forward, backward, etc.). The goal of the project is to enable an agent to solve a generated maze as efficiently as possible and record the key differences and findings.

## Live Demo
A live demo of the project is not currently available.

## How to Build and Run
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the project files from the repository.
2. Open the project in your Python environment.
3. Execute the Python file containing the A* algorithm implementation.

The program will generate a maze and attempt to solve it using the A* algorithm. It will record the key differences and findings during the process.

## Tech Used
The project is developed using Python and implements the A* algorithm for maze solving.

## Development Process and Challenges
The development process involved understanding and implementing the A* algorithm and its various versions. The main challenge encountered was ensuring the efficient and correct implementation of the algorithm to solve the generated mazes. Despite these challenges, the project successfully solves the mazes and records the key differences and findings.
